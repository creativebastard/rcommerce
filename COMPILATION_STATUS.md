Redis Upgrade to 1.0 Stable:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Updated Cargo.toml to redis = "1.0"
✅ Rewrote RedisConnection for redis 1.0 API
✅ Changed AsyncConnection to MultiplexedConnection
✅ Fixed Value::Bulk → Value::Array rename
✅ Added missing methods: incr, publish, exists (single key)
✅ Fixed method signatures for AsRef<[u8]> generics

Top Remaining Error Categories (91 errors):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
49 error[E0308]: mismatched types (various type incompatibilities)
 6 error[E0277]: Try trait issues (async/sync mismatch)
 3 error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 3 error[E0277]: `?` couldn't convert errors
 2 error[E0596]: cannot borrow data as mutable
 1 error[E0609]: no field `receiver` on pubsub types
 1 error[E0509]: cannot move out of type (Drop trait)
 1 error[E0499]: cannot borrow func as mutable more than once

Key Remaining Blockers:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔧 websocket/broadcast.rs - receiver field access issues (structural)
🔧 cache/pubsub.rs - stream unfold move issues with receiver
🔧 performance/benchmark.rs - func mutable borrow issue
🔧 Input/output type mismatches in rate_limit middleware

Summary:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
We've successfully upgraded to redis 1.0 stable (1.0.2 current).
The 91 remaining errors are mostly structural issues in:
- websocket/broadcast module (stream handling, receiver access)
- notification channels (trait scoping for send methods)
- various type conversions between similar but distinct types

For a core working system (products/orders/customers), these peripheral 
modules (websocket, pubsub, advanced rate limiting) could be stubbed while
the core functionality is verified working.

To get to full compilation, the main work remaining is:
1. Fix websocket broadcast/stream handling
2. Fix notification channel send method resolution  
3. Add remaining minor method implementations needed by consuming code
