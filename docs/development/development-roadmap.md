## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Rust complexity for web development**
   - Mitigation: Use well-established crates (Axum, SQLx)
   - Team training investment

2. **Async Rust learning curve**
   - Mitigation: Clear error handling patterns, extensive documentation
   - Pair programming for complex async code

3. **Database abstraction limitations**
   - Mitigation: Provider-specific optimizations, clear trade-offs documented
   - PostgreSQL as primary, others as second-class initially

4. **Dependency on third-party services**
   - Mitigation: Abstract interfaces, mock implementations for testing
   - Multiple payment/shipping provider options

### Timeline Risks
1. **Underestimation of complexity**
   - Buffer built into estimates (20%)
   - Feature cutting criteria defined
   - Phased delivery approach

2. **Integration challenges**
   - Start integrations early (Phase 2)
   - Providers with good documentation prioritized
   - Testing accounts setup early

### Market Risks
1. **Competition from established platforms**
   - Focus on performance & simplicity as differentiators
   - Excellent documentation and developer experience
   - Active community building early
