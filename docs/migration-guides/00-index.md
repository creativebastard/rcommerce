## Migration Approach

### Two Migration Strategies

#### 1. Big Bang Migration
- All data migrated at once
- Downtime required
- Simpler but riskier
- Good for: Small stores, off-season migration

#### 2. Phased Migration
- Migrate in stages
- Zero or minimal downtime
- More complex but safer
- Good for: Large stores, high-traffic stores

### Using the Compatibility Layer

R commerce provides compatibility layers that allow you to:

1. **Run both platforms simultaneously**
   - Use R commerce for new features
   - Keep existing platform running
   - Gradually migrate functionality

2. **Test before full migration**
   - Verify data integrity
   - Test integrations
   - Validate performance

3. **Rollback capability**
   - If issues arise, revert to original platform
   - Minimal business disruption

## Migration Checklist

### Migration Execution

- [ ] Migrate orders (optional, for reporting)
- [ ] Set up payment gateways
- [ ] Configure shipping
- [ ] Set up tax rules
- [ ] Test checkout flow
- [ ] Test order management

## Migration Tools

### CLI Migration Tool

```bash
# Install migration tool
cargo install rcommerce-migrate

# List available migrations
rcommerce-migrate list

# Analyze current platform
rcommerce-migrate analyze --platform shopify --api-key SHOP_KEY

# Perform migration
rcommerce-migrate run \
  --from shopify \
  --to rcommerce \
  --config migration.toml

# Dry run (test without committing)
rcommerce-migrate run --dry-run

# Verbose logging
rcommerce-migrate run --verbose
```

### Migration Config Format

```toml
# migration.toml
[migration]
source_platform = "shopify"  # or "woocommerce", "magento"
target_platform = "rcommerce"
strategy = "phased"          # or "big_bang"
dry_run = false

[source]
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
api_secret = "YOUR_API_SECRET"
store_url = "https://your-store.myshopify.com"

[target]
r_commerce_url = "https://api.yourstore.com"
r_commerce_api_key = "sk_xxx"

[migration.options]
migrate_products = true
migrate_customers = true
migrate_orders = true
migrate_categories = true
migrate_reviews = false
skip_duplicates = true
update_existing = false
chunk_size = 100
rate_limit_per_second = 2

[migration.mapping]
# Map source fields to target fields
# Shopify product type → R commerce category
product_type_field = "custom.product_type"

# WooCommerce attributes → R commerce tags
attribute_to_tags = true

# Magento customer groups → R commerce groups
customer_group_mapping = "auto"

[migration.validation]
check_inventory = true
verify_pricing = true
validate_addresses = true
run_fraud_check = false
```

## Data Mapping Challenges

### Product Complexity
- **Shopify**: Simple products with variants
- **WooCommerce**: Variable products with attributes
- **Magento**: Complex product types (configurable, bundled, grouped)
- **R commerce**: Unified product model with variants

### Customer Accounts
- Password migration (usually not possible, require reset)
- Customer group structures
- Loyalty points/programs
- Subscription data

### Order History
- Order numbering schemes
- Order status mapping
- Partial refunds/exchanges
- Multi-currency orders

### SEO Preservation
- URL redirects (critical!)
- Meta data migration
- Sitemap structure
- Search engine indexing

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Shopify
- **API Rate Limits**: 2 requests/second by default
- **Plus Stores**: Higher limits, better for migration
- **Shopify Plus**: Use GraphQL Admin API for bulk operations
- **Assets**: Images, files need separate download/upload

### WooCommerce
- **WordPress Integration**: Must handle WP users, posts
- **Plugin Data**: Many plugins store data in postmeta
- **Custom Attributes**: Variable mapping required
- **Database Direct**: Can use direct database access for speed

### Magento
- **EAV Model**: Complex database structure
- **Multiple Stores**: Store view mapping
- **Custom Attributes**: Extensive attribute systems
- **Enterprise Features**: B2B features may not have equivalents

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Underestimating Time**
   - Large catalogs take days, not hours
   - Order history migration is slow
   - Testing phase often takes longer than expected

2. **Data Loss Risks**
   - Always backup before migrating
   - Test integrity after migration
   - Keep original data until confirmed

3. **SEO Impact**
   - Missing redirects = lost rankings
   - Change content = re-indexing time
   - Plan for temporary traffic drop

4. **Integration Breakage**
   - Payment webhooks need updating
   - Shipping integrations may break
   - CRM/email marketing connections
   - Accounting system integrations

5. **Performance Issues**
   - New platform may need tuning
   - Different caching strategies
   - Database optimization needed

## Testing Checklist
